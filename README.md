# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection with Machine Learning

This project is a web-based **Spam Email Detector** built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Streamlit**. It allows users to input any email message and receive real-time predictions on whether it is spam or not.

##  Features

- Classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Built with **Naive Bayes** and **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Streamlit-powered interactive **web UI**
- Handles invalid/random inputs with proper warning messages
- Real-time prediction with a clean interface

- ##  Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Dataset**: Based on SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI)
- **Accuracy**: ~97% (evaluated on test data)

-  ## How to Run

-  open terminal and paste
-  " streamlit run app.py "
-  it will only run when you open the code in VS and then Run through terminal then it will generate a link
